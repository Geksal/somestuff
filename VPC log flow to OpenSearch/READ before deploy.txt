AWS Resource Deletion Error Summary
You encountered dependency errors while trying to delete AWS resources using Terraform:

1.Security Group deletion failed because it has dependent resources
2.Subnet deletion failed due to dependencies

Resolution
If you encounter these dependency violations when running terraform destroy, the solution is typically to:

1.Identify and delete the Network Interface (ENI) resources in your AWS account
2.ENIs are often the dependent resources preventing deletion of security groups and subnets
3.Find these ENIs in the AWS Console in the us-east-1 region
4.After manually deleting the ENIs, you can run terraform destroy again to complete the cleanup

This is a common issue when Terraform can't automatically remove all dependencies, particularly with networking resources that might be attached to other AWS services.
